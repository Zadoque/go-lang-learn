## Summary
This video likely covers setting up the Go development environment on your local machine. Based on the series progression, it probably walks through downloading and installing Go, configuring environment variables, setting up a code editor (likely VS Code), and writing a first "Hello World" program.

## Expected Topics
- Downloading Go from the official website
- Installing Go on different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Setting up environment variables (GOPATH, GOROOT)
- Installing VS Code and Go extensions
- Creating a simple Go project structure
- Writing and running the first Go program

## Expected Code Example
```go
// main.go - First Go program
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, Go world!")
}
```

## Setup Instructions
1. Download Go from golang.org
2. Install according to your operating system instructions
3. Verify installation with `go version` in terminal
4. Set up environment variables if needed
5. Install VS Code and Go extension
6. Create a new project folder
7. Initialize a Go module with `go mod init example.com/hello`
8. Create main.go with Hello World program
9. Run with `go run main.go`

## Module Initialization
```bash
# Initialize a new Go module
go mod init video-3/hello
```
