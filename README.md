# Go Language Learning Repository

This repository documents my journey learning the Go programming language by following the YouTube playlist [Learn Go Programming](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRAV69dS1uWQGDQoBYMZWKjzuhCaOnBpa).

## Repository Purpose

This is a structured learning environment where I track my progress through Go programming tutorials, store code examples, and document key concepts as I learn them. Each video's content is isolated in its own directory with relevant code and notes.

## Repository Structure

```
go-learning/
├── README.md                 # This file
├── video-1/
│   ├── README.md             # Video 1 notes and 
│   ├── main.go               # Code examples from

|   ├── ...
```

## Organization Details

Each video directory follows a consistent format:

- **README.md**: Contains
  - Direct link to the specific video
  - Summary of key concepts covered
  - Personal notes and observations
  - Any additional resources referenced

- **main.go**: Implementation of code examples from the video

- **go.mod**: Module definition created with `go mod init [module-name]`

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go installed on your machine (download from [golang.org](https://golang.org/dl/))
- Git for version control
- Code editor (VS Code, Goland, Vim, etc.)

### How to Use This Repository

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Navigate to the video folder you're currently studying
3. Read the README.md for that video to understand the concepts
4. Examine the main.go file to see the implementation
5. Run the code using `go run main.go`
6. Modify and experiment with the code to deepen understanding

## Learning Journey

I'll be updating this repository as I progress through the video series. Each directory represents a milestone in my Go learning journey and contains the practical implementations of concepts learned.
